### Web | HomeBuddy website

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0Shark/SindiAIDev/main/screenshots/web.png" width="700">

We created HomeBuddy to be easily accessible by the users and serve as registration domain for all users. The website also includes log in using your face with the face_recognition module, but it won't work on the web due to hosting limitations, so you can still try it out by downloading the website here:

### [HomeBuddy.ml - Files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12X0-BNVl4Q2d9qFQWHEfkTESfvOw56mW/view?usp=sharing)

If you want to check the HomeBuddy.ml code download the files from the [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12X0-BNVl4Q2d9qFQWHEfkTESfvOw56mW/view?usp=sharing) and extract the files.

1) Firstly you need to have a local server running (for exp. WAMP)

2) After that you need to import the *database.sql* file into your local database managment framework (for exp. PhpMyAdmin)
#### Unessential procedure
To use the face_recognition features you need to install the python modules on requirements.txt.
```sh
cd YOURDIRECTORY
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After the modules have been installed you can head over to localhost/homebuddy/ on your webbrowser.

#### [HomeBuddy.ml](https://homebuddy.ml)

- We hosted the website on 000webhost and aquired a free domain from Freenom
- The website is protected by CloudFlare security and posses a SSL certificate

## Installation
#### Before installation please make sure you are registered on the [web](https://homebuddy.ml) and you downloaded your data!
#### Sindi uses your custom preferences data to respond to you. 
SindiAI is built in [Python 3.6.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/) so make sure you have it installed together with *pip*
 
Next you need to clone the repository or just [download](https://github.com/0Shark/SindiAIDev/archive/main.zip) it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/0Shark/SindiAIDev
```

After that you can change directory to there

```sh
cd /YOURFOLDER/sindiai/
```
We recommend creating a virtual environment to manage your modules more easily, in this case we used anaconda to create the environment like this:
```sh
conda create -n sindiai python==3.6.6
```
![Error](https://github.com/0Shark/SindiAIDev/blob/main/screenshots/Screenshot_3.png?raw=true)

Now activate the environment:
```sh
conda activate sindiai
```

NOTE: You can also install Sindi directly on your main Python installation but it may lead to small errors.

Now you can install all the required modules with this command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

![Error](https://github.com/0Shark/SindiAIDev/blob/main/screenshots/Screenshot_5.png?raw=true)

After installing all the modules, make sure to have a MySQL local server running. In this case we are running Wamp(Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP).

![Error](https://github.com/0Shark/SindiAIDev/blob/main/screenshots/Screenshot_36.png?raw=true)

Then you can run to create the database:
```sh
python create_db.py
```

![Error](https://github.com/0Shark/SindiAIDev/blob/main/screenshots/Screenshot_6.png?raw=true)

After the database has been created you can start using SindiAI by running:
```sh
python server.py
```

If you are asked to allow access to Firewall please do so.

![Error](https://github.com/0Shark/SindiAIDev/blob/main/screenshots/Screenshot_7.png?raw=true)

And head over to 127.0.0.1:8000 on any web browser, or local ip of pc to use on other devices on your local network. *Example: 192.168.1.2:8000*

![Error](https://github.com/0Shark/SindiAIDev/blob/main/screenshots/Screenshot_9.png?raw=true)

Make sure you are registred on the [HomeBuddy](https://homebuddyweb.000webhostapp.com) website and you got your FaceHash together with your json data file. 
Your data should be located on */sindiai/users/data/*

### You are ready to chat with Sindi!
![Error](https://github.com/0Shark/SindiAIDev/blob/main/screenshots/Screenshot_11.png?raw=true)

### Wit integration
The moment we send input to Sindi a chain of functions are activated. 
First we send the input to Wit where it is classified into intents, entities and traits.

![Error](https://github.com/0Shark/SindiAIDev/blob/main/screenshots/Screenshot_13.png?raw=true)
| What are intents? | What are entities? | What are traits? |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |
| We have created these intents to classify the response | Entities detect certain objects in the user input (genre, age, date) | Traits help us detect a trait about in sentence (sntiment ex. happy) |

We have manually trained the app with nearly 300 sentences, labelling each type of data.

### Audio files

Sindi has a decent amount of speech audio generated with play.ht and music genres that can be modified to your preferences.
Make sure you add your own music files on the *sindiai/music/* directory. 

| Type | Items |
| ------ | ------ |
| text | 42 |
| number | 29 (audio files used to create other numbers) |
| jokes | 8 |
| months | 12 |
| music | 10 genres (where you can store your music)|
